# programming-bitcoin-rust

This repo is intented to be an way to learn `rust` at same time i learn how Bitcoin works.
It isn't intent to be used as a real production code.

For it i used Jimmy Song's [Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin),
with the difference that the exercises will be implemented in `rust` instead of `python`.
